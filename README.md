## üíº Work & Affiliations

### Co-Founder, [Supertype](https://supertype.ai)
Supertype is a data science and engineering consultancy that build AI products, data infrastructure and analytics automations for leading institutions in Indonesia and the broader SEA region.

Algoritma is a data science education center and the first of its kind to offer a comprehensive data science bootcamp spanning 4 months and 144 hours of industry-grade, in-person data science lessons.

We count more than 300 corporate clients and more than 2,000 alumni since our inception in 2016. 

### Co-Founder, [Sectors Financial Data Suite](https://sectors.app)
Sectors is an always-learning financial data platform built for
Indonesia's stock investors, researchers, and leading institutions. Underlying the
data infrastructure is a collection of data pipelines connecting the IDX
(Indonesia Stock Exchange), industry-leading data providers, and
lots of proprietary, first-party market research.

It comes with a generous forever-free tier, and paid subscription tiers for users who would like to support the platform and access more advanced features. 

I regularly write its community blog and dev log on [Sectors Community Bulletin](https://sectors.app/bulletin).


### Data Science and Engineering Consultant

Through my work at Supertype, I lead the data science and engineering initiatives at [Alamtri Resources Indonesia (IDX: ADRO)](https://sectors.app/idx/adro) as well as a number of other clients in the financial industry and regulatory space.

I guest-lecture at (current or past):
Singapore NTUC, IBF Singapore, Ngee Ann Polytechnic's CET, University of Indonesia (through IBM) etc.


#### ‚è≥ Past Work
Prior to 2015, I've lived for more than a year each in Japan and China, in my capacity as a consultant for:
SEGA, Disney, Gumi, FunPlus, etc.

I've also been a CEO of a startup, HyperGrowth, a company specializing in marketing automation and fraud detection, with its flagship product GrowthBot being among the pioneers of Slack-based marketing chatbots. I sold the company in 2016.

## ‚òï Personal
I've lived in many places, and a home-owner in Bogor, Indonesia. I am fluent in English, Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese (Mandarin), Bahasa Melayu and an A2 level in German. 

I've started my first company (as a one-third partner) at 16, and have had my fair share of failures and successes. I'm a big believer in the power of education and apprenticeship, so if you're a third- or final-year student looking to intern / work with us (or just need general career advice), reach out to me. I'd love to buy you coffee and chat.
